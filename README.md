# BusTrackingAPI
I have used MAPBOX to complete an exercise that requires to show in a webpage all the bus stops from MIT to HARVARD.
The stops move at a pace of one per second until the bus arrives to Harvard.
This is part of a exercise requires for the MITxPRO certificate in Full stack Development with MERN. (See license for more information.)
To run this repo you will need to run bustracker.html in a webserver and replace the MapboxGL access token with your own.
Future improvements of this repo should include more bus routes and real time information of the bus location.
